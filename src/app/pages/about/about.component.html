            Jeremy’s drive to offer a positive difference in the aged care home care industry was sparked after searching for home care for his 80 year old father.  “People usually search for home care triggered by a stressful family situation and my experience was that the industry did little to initially alleviate that, ” says Jeremy. “It is near impossible to compare in-home care providers when they are all charging a range of extra fees. He realised that the industry needed to be revitalised through introducing a new approach to home care that provides transparency in regard to pricing, as well as information about who will deliver the care and the quality of care.  
            <br><br>
            Jeremy believes that the best business model for in-home care is one of full process ownership. “I soon realised the service provider needed to own the full experience” says Jeremy. “For us to fulfil a duty of care whilst offering a superior service, the care workers have to be Tend employees and the care recipients Tend clients.” 
            <br><br>
            He believes that technology will dramatically increase efficiencies, transparency and enhance the overall home care experience. “Most of our custom made technology works seamlessly behind the scenes, whilst also underpinning our quality service delivery. Our innovative technology is designed purely to enhance the Tend experience, largely through connectedness. Our client facing technology is optional- we are very conscious that our service is ultimately judged on who walks in the door and the care they deliver” says Jeremy.

            Jeremy was awarded a Japanese Government Monbusho Undergraduate Scholarship in 1991 and graduated from Kobe University with a Bachelor in Economics. He spent 20 years in Tokyo and Singapore working in various finance related roles including Managing Director roles at Lehman Brothers and Nomura Securities where he traded fixed income products and managed teams.
