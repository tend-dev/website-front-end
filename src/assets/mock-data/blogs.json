    "content": "<p>The world’s population is getting older. Across the globe, people are living longer thanks to advances in healthcare, nutrition and technology. This population shift brings with it incredible possibilities — but also a new set of challenges. So … How do we care for our elderly?</p><p>Writer and scholar Jared Diamond (TED Talk: How societies can grow old better) examines the vast differences in how societies across the globe view and treat their senior citizens. Some groups revere and respect their oldest members, while others see them as senile and incompetent, making them the butt of jokes. In some societies, children care for their parents at home; in others, children put their parents in homes where others care for them. Some cultures see their elderly as a burden and resource drain and opt for more violent approaches to senior care. Here’s a look at how people across the globe treat their old folks.</p><img src=\"/assets/mock-data/img/1/content/img-2.jpg\" alt=\"article image\"/><h2>So just who is considered old?</h2><p>The United Nations deems that elderly begins at 60, and celebrates the <a href=\"/\" target=\"_blank\">International Day of Older Persons</a> in October each year to acknowledge the contributions to society made by those no longer spring chickens. According to Diamond, the perceived value of the elderly is an important factor in determining whether seniors are respected or not. This may be a function of who is considered old and when. In the United States a senior citizen is defined as someone who is 65+. In New Guinea, anyone aged 50 or over is considered lapun, or an “old man.” As Diamond points out in his book, <a href=\"/\">The World Until Yesterday</a>, the 15-year gap has wide implications, as the two groups tend to have different physical and mental abilities at different ages.</p><ul><li>The United Nations</li><li>International Day of Older Persons</li><li>According to Diamond</li><li>United States</li><li>New Guinea</li><li>The World Until Yesterday</li></ul><h2>Where do the elderly live?</h2><p>The Confucian teaching of filial piety shapes the living arrangements of the elderly in Asia. About three quarters of elderly Japanese parents live with their adult children, a pattern replicated in Korea and China. China’s Elderly Rights Law mandates that children visit their parents frequently, no matter how far away they live. If children don’t comply, they could face fines or jail time. “We raise our children to take care of us when we get old,” one Chinese senior citizen told the <a href=\"https://bbc.com\" target=\"_blank\">BBC</a>.</p>",
